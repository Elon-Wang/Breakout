# Breakout
The course project of EE332 at SUSTech, which using the FPGA board Nexys Artix-7.  
We use arduino as a handle and use bluetooth module(HC-05) too send the message to the FPGA board to play the game.  
The game part is inspired by the edoji's project (https://github.com/edolj/VHDL-BreakoutGame), which helps a lot. And we fix some parts to make it fit in better in our project and rebuild it.  
The project was done and updated by Elon-Wang and WSEK.  
  
TODO: two player mode.
